During 1996 and 1997, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a study to
determine the cause(s) of population decline and low survival of pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra
americana) fawns on Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (HMNAR) located in southeast-
ern Oregon (USA). As part of that study, blood, fecal, and tissue samples from 104 neonatal
fawns, 40 adult does, and nine adult male pronghorns were collected to conduct a health eval-
uation of the population. Physiological parameters related to nutrition and/or disease were stud-
ied. No abnormalities were found in the complete blood cell counts of adults (n 5 40) or fawns
(n 5 44 to 67). Serum total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were lower compared
to other pronghorn populations. Does had mean BUN values significantly lower (P , 0.001) in
December 1996 than March 1997. Serum copper (Cu) levels in does (range 0.39 to 0.74 ppm)
were considered marginal when compared to domestic animals and other wild ungulates. Fawns
had low (0.28 ppm) Cu levels at birth and reached the doesâ€™ marginal values in about 3 days.
Whole blood, serum and liver selenium (Se) levels were considered marginal to low in most
segments of the pronghorn population. However, serum levels of vitamin E (range 1.98 to 3.27
mg/ml), as determined from the does captured in March, were apparently sufficient to offset any
signs of Se deficiency. No clinical signs of Cu or Se deficiency were observed. Fifty-five of 87
dead fawns were necropsied. Trauma, due to predation by coyotes (Canis latrans), accounted for
62% of the mortality during mid-May to mid-July of each year. Other causes included predation
by golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) (4%), dystocia (2%), septicemic pasteurellosis (4%), starva-
tion (5%), and unknown (23%). Adult females were tested for serum neutralizing antibodies to
Brucella spp. (n 5 20, negative), Leptospira interrogans (n 5 20, negative), bluetongue virus (n
5 20, 35% positive), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (n 5 20, 30% positive), respiratory
syncytial virus (n 5 18, negative), parainfluenza virus type 3 (n 5 18, 67% positive), infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis (n 5 18, negative), and bovine viral diarrhea (n 5 18, negative). Consid-
ering the parameters examined, we found no apparent predisposing factors to mortality including
those killed by coyotes, but some nutritional parameters suggest that pronghorns on HMNAR
exist on a diet low in protein and Se and marginal in Cu. The effect these factors have on the
population is not known.
